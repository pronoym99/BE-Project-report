\chapter{Conclusions} \label{chapter7}

A CNC based PCB milling machine capable of milling only single-sided PCBs of maximum dimensions 15 x 15 cm was developed. All the basics of CNC based milling and CAD/CAM processing were studied and used in this project. The entire structure was primarily made of wood while the various rods and shafts used materials ranging from moderate steel to stainless steel. Various aspects of mechanical engineering were learned in the process. These include (but not limited to) cutting, filing, drilling, polishing of various surfaces and common measurement techniques. \par

On similar terms, multiple concepts related to electronics were learned during the development phase of the project. These include (but not limited to) standard calibration procedures, understanding the motor operation and capacity limitations, effective wiring and simple software-based concepts such as Gerber files and G-code conversion. \par

Overall it turned out to be a complete knowledge enriching experience in a multitude of domains.
